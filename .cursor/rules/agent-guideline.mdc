# Guideline

- Always first share the plan how you will carry out the task and wait for my confirmation before actual implementation.
- If you encounter error, pause there. Then, share with me your plan on how you will fix the error and wait for my confirmation before implementing actual fix.
- Always ask clarifying questions.
